    "#### We'll use this to generate our target vectors. The input vectors are less obvious. You don't want to just use a one-dimensional vector containing the input number, for a couple of reasons. A single input captures an \"intensity\", but the fact that 2 is twice as much as 1, and that 4 is twice as much again, doesn't feel relevant to this problem. Additionally, with just one input the hidden layer wouldn't be able to compute very interesting features, which means it probably wouln't be able to solve the problem. It turns out that one thing that works reasonably well is to convert each number to its *binary* representation of 1s and 0s."
